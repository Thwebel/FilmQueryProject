# FilmQueryProject

## Overview
This project is a command-line application that retrieves and displays film data. Users are able to search for film data by film id number or by keywords. When found, films matching the look up id or any of the keywords searched are displayed with their title, release year, rating (e.g. G, PG, etc), language, cast list, and a brief plot description. The data is being pulled from a local MySQL database.
